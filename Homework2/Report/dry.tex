\section{Why is ChatGPT wrong}
The current solution by ChatGPT works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item It returns pairs of students in lexicographic order - in which:
	\item If we look at the set of courses taken by both students take -
		the minimal grade of the first student is smaller than that of the second student 
\end{itemize}

\section{Mistake Illustration - Counter Example}
One possible counter example to the sol of ChatGPT is:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
		\hline
		StudentName & Course & Grade & Semester\\ 
		\hline
		adam & db & 99 & winter23\\ 
		\hline
		bob & db & 88 & winter23\\  
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
His solution on this table would be $\emptyset$ (which is wrong) - 
since adam is smaller than bob lexicographicly
but adams grade is higher than that of bob.\\
Insead, the correct solution would be $\{adam,bob\}$.\\
Hence ChatGPT's solution is wrong.

\section{A correct implementation}
Our alternative implementation is:
\begin{qv}
(
	SELECT l1.StudentName, l2.StudentName
	FROM Learns l1, Learns l2
	WHERE l1.StudentName!=l2.StudentName
		AND l1.Semester=l2.Semester
		AND l1.Grade<l2.Grade
		AND l1.Course=l2.Course
)
-
(
	SELECT l1.StudentName, l2.StudentName
	FROM Learns l1, Learns l2
	WHERE l1.Semester!=l2.Semester
		OR l1.Course!=l2.Course
)
\end{qv}
