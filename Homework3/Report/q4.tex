\section{Vatiations on Armstrong's Axioms}
\subsection{}
Yes. Since this system has less of \textbf{FREEDOM} than the armstrong system,
any proof generated by the reduced system is also a proof in the armstrong system.\\
In particular - our system is satisfied by the correctness of the armstrong system.

\subsection{}
No.\\
For example, let $F:=\{A\rightarrow B, A\rightarrow C\}$.\\

\begin{lemma}
	In our reduced axiom system - regarding $F$, for any rule $X\rightarrow Y$:\\
	The number of attributes in the right operand is never
	larger than the number of attributes in the left operand.\\
	We denote this as $|X|\geq |Y|$.
\end{lemma}
\textbf{Lemma Proof.}\\
By induction on the number of lines in a formal proof the rule.\\
\textbf{Base:} By reflexivity or FD from $F$.\\
\textbf{Step:} Reflexivity or FD like in the Base case.
Transitivity:\\
We have already shown $W\rightarrow Y$, and that $Z\rightarrow W$. We now show
$Z\rightarrow Y$.
From the induction hypothesis - $|W|\geq |Y| \wedge |Z|\geq |W|$ Thus $|Z|\geq|Y|$.\\

Due to the lemma, in the reduced system, $A\rightarrow BC$ cannot be implied by $F$.
While union is provable in the armstrong system (which means $A\rightarrow BC$ can be implied by $F$ in the armstring system).
